# android-mcp-windows-setup

**Working setup guide and fix pack for [android-mcp](https://github.com/growvv/Android-Automation-MCP) on Windows.**

The `android-mcp` npm package works great on Linux/macOS but fails silently on Windows due to several environmental issues. This repo contains a one-shot PowerShell setup script and the missing Python bridge file that fix all of them.

---

## What This Solves

Installing `android-mcp` on Windows and pointing Claude Code's MCP config at it results in a broken chain — tools appear registered but silently fail. Five distinct issues cause this:

| # | Problem | Root Cause |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | `adb` not found | ADB platform-tools not in the PATH seen by the MCP server process |
| 2 | `python` resolves to Windows Store stub | Windows ships a fake `python.exe` that opens the Store — real Python 3.x at a non-standard path |
| 3 | `uiautomator2` not installed | Package missing from the Python environment MCP actually uses |
| 4 | Python bridge script missing | `uiautomator2_bridge.py` is not included in the npm package — must be created manually |
| 5 | Bridge gets deleted on `npm update` | Since the bridge lives inside the npm package directory, any update wipes it |

This repo fixes all five and makes the setup reproducible.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18+)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to a known path (not the Windows Store version)
- [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (for `adb`)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with MCP support
- Android device with USB debugging enabled, OR an Android emulator

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/mvahora2023/android-mcp-windows-setup.git
cd android-mcp-windows-setup

# 2. Review the portable path defaults near the top of setup-android-mcp.ps1.
#    Adjust PYTHON / PIP / ANDROID_HOME only if installed elsewhere.

# 3. Run the setup script
powershell -File setup-android-mcp.ps1

# After reviewing the configuration and preview:
powershell -File setup-android-mcp.ps1 -Apply

# 4. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers
```

## What the Setup Script Does

`setup-android-mcp.ps1` runs these steps in order, idempotently:

1. **Checks prerequisites** — verifies Python, ADB, and Node.js are reachable at the configured paths
2. **Installs android-mcp globally** — `npm install -g android-mcp`
3. **Restores the bridge script** — copies `uiautomator2_bridge.py` from this repo into the npm package directory (survives future `npm update` runs when you re-run the script)
4. **Installs uiautomator2** — `pip install uiautomator2` using the real Python binary
5. **Patches `~/.claude.json`** — ensures the `android-automation` MCP entry exists with the correct PATH and ANDROID_HOME environment variables
6. **Checks ADB device connection** — reports connected devices or warns if none found

You can re-run it after an `npm update`, but review what it will install or modify first. The script has not been independently tested here on every Windows configuration.

## Configuration

**Safety:** Running with no arguments is preview-only. Pass `-Apply` to install packages and modify your Claude configuration. Keep a backup of your existing config. The script has not been verified on every Windows configuration.

The script now uses paths derived from your Windows user environment and its own
repository folder. **Check that the defaults match your installation**. Python
may live elsewhere, so update the variables at the start of
`setup-android-mcp.ps1` if needed:

```powershell
$ANDROID_HOME  = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Android\Sdk"
$PYTHON        = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Python\bin\python.exe"
$PIP           = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Python\bin\pip.exe"
$ADB           = Join-Path $ANDROID_HOME "platform-tools\adb.exe"
$BRIDGE_BACKUP = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "uiautomator2_bridge.py"
```

The MCP environment prepends Android tools and the selected Python directories to
the current PATH. Before editing Claude's configuration, the script creates a timestamped backup
of `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json`.


**Finding your real Python path:**

```powershell
# This shows all python.exe on your system — pick the real one, not WindowsApps
where.exe python
Get-Command python | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
```

**Finding your npm global prefix:**

```powershell
npm prefix -g
```

---

## After Setup: First-Time Device Init

Once the script completes successfully:

```powershell
# Confirm your device is visible
adb devices

# Initialize uiautomator2 on the device (run once per device)
python -m uiautomator2 init
```

Then restart Claude Code. The `android-automation` MCP tools should now appear.

---

## Claude Code MCP Config

The script updates the per-user `.claude.json` file and writes a backup before changes. If you prefer to configure it manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "android-automation": {
      "command": "android-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "ANDROID_HOME": "C:\\Path\\To\\Android\\Sdk",
        "PATH": "C:\\Path\\To\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools;C:\\Path\\To\\Python\\bin;C:\\Path\\To\\Python\\Scripts;C:\\Path\\To\\npm\\global;C:\\Program Files\\nodejs;C:\\Windows\\system32;C:\\Windows"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env.PATH` override is critical — without it, the MCP server process inherits a PATH that either misses ADB or points to the Windows Store Python stub.

## Files in This Repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `setup-android-mcp.ps1` | One-shot setup and repair script |
| `uiautomator2_bridge.py` | Python bridge that android-mcp requires but doesn't ship |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Troubleshooting

**`android-mcp: command not found` after install**
→ npm global bin directory is not in your system PATH. Add the output of `npm prefix -g` + `\` to your PATH, or use the full path in the MCP config's `command` field.

**`uiautomator2` ImportError**
→ The wrong Python is being used. Check that `$PYTHON` in the script points to the real Python binary, and that `uiautomator2` is installed in that environment.

**Device shows as `unauthorized` in `adb devices`**
→ Disconnect and reconnect the USB cable, then accept the "Allow USB debugging" prompt on the device.

**Tools appear in Claude but return errors**
→ Run `setup-android-mcp.ps1` again (it's idempotent), then restart Claude Code.

## Interactive project dashboard (November 2026)

- **[Open this project's public interactive explorer](https://arsh-project-lab.vercel.app/android-mcp-windows-setup/index.html)**
- **[Run the standalone HTML locally](dashboard/index.html)** (no account or service required)
- **[Open the complete public Project Lab](https://arsh-project-lab.vercel.app/)**

Review a user-controlled Windows/Android setup checklist; no device connection. Source-linked sample data is embedded for offline inspection. Search, group filters and CSV export work locally; checklist review marks (where available) are browser-local only. The page is not a live backend, and changes in this repository will require a separate Vercel deployment until a Git integration is enabled. [Dashboard validation source](tests/dashboard_ui.test.mjs).

## Data modes and privacy (November 2026)

- **Default:** The existing dashboard or portfolio view displays labeled synthetic or authored demonstration material. The GitHub profile index is the exception: it lists **actual public repositories** and uses separate synthetic UI tests, not invented projects.
- **Public references:** Open the project's dashboard and choose a verified public source. Records load only when you click **Load public references**; source provenance and retrieval information appear alongside the results. Public references never overwrite fictional KPIs, audit findings, or simulated incident results.
- **Local data:** Disabled for the public web interface. No local files, personal accounts, Windows logs, connected devices, or private GitHub repositories are imported. Other command-line utilities in this repository remain separate from the public web interface.
- **Source policy:** See [source manifest](data/source-manifest.json). Public fetches may be limited by third-party availability, rate limits, and browser security restrictions; the synthetic view works without them.
- **Safety:** Do not publish personal documents, tokens, passwords, real user-directory paths, or identifying log records. Existing Git history may retain older versions; replacing a current file does not erase history.
